# Fallstudie-stylo-16-Jh.

Fallstudie zur Anwendung maschineller Lernverfahren auf lyrische Texte des 16. Jh.:
Repository containing material for a stylometric analysis using R Studio and stylo package as described in chapter 4 of Frank Siekmann's master's thesis at LMU Munich 2025

# Textual corpus

Due to copyright the textual corpus used to run the stylometric analysis can't be published here. Instead, in chapter 4 of Frank Siekmann's master's thesis at LMU Munich, you can find a detailed list of the texts used and the preparational measures performed on the texts. Thus, the corpus can be rebuilt by anyone.

# Results

In this repository you find the results of the stylometric analysis as PNG and PDF files. This way, you have access to the complete data behind the research in chapter 4 of Frank Siekmann's master's thesis (in chapter 4 only two diagrams and a clipping of a diagram could be published due to the limited space of the thesis)

# Copyright

To run the stylometric analysis the following software was used (as indicated in Frank Siekmann's master's thesis):

- EDER, Maciej/RYBICKI, Jan/KESTEMONT, Mike 2016: „Stylometry with R: a package for computational text analysis“, in: R Journal, Vol. 8, 1, p. 107–121.
